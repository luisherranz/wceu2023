# Building Interactive Blocks workshop

Welcome to the GitHub repository of the [WordCamp Europe 2023 workshop, Building Interactive blocks](https://europe.wordcamp.org/2023/session/building-interactive-blocks-a-step-by-step-workshop/) by [Luis Herranz](https://twitter.com/luisherranz).

In this workshop, we learned how to create interactive blocks using the [Interactivity API](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/30/proposal-the-interactivity-api-a-better-developer-experience-in-building-interactive-blocks/).

> **⚠️ Important note:** At the time of the workshop, the version of the Interactivity API was different and still wasn't included in WordPress Core. The workshop recording still refers to the old code
>
> The code of the `main` branch **has been updated to the latest version of the Interactivity API** so you can run it using the latest version of WordPress.
>
> If you want, you can still view the old code on the `step` branches: [old code](https://github.com/luisherranz/wceu2023/commits/step22/)

## Preparation steps 🧑‍🍳

    _Not necessary if you have Node >= 18._

2. Clone this repository, or [download it](https://github.com/luisherranz/wceu23/archive/refs/heads/step0.zip)

    _Cloning is recommended, but downloading is also fine._

3. Run `npm install`

    _This may take a while, so do it as soon as you get the repository._

That's it! You don't need to install anything or do anything else just yet.

### How to follow the workshop 🧐

The workshop is divided in steps.

You can…

1.  **Write all the code**

    _Not recommended unless you are already familiar with the Interactivity API._

2.  **Copy and paste the [code snippets of each step from here](https://github.com/luisherranz/wceu23/commits/step-22)**

    _Only recommended if you are familiar with block development._

3.  **Use `git` to move through the steps**

    _The easiest one! Good to follow along even if you're not familiar with block development._

    _To move through the steps, you can use this command:_

    -   `git checkout step0`
    -   `git checkout step1`
    -   ...

**Important**: you can see [the changes of each step here](https://github.com/luisherranz/wceu23/commits/step-22).
